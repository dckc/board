[announcement from leiterhaus May 8][1]:

The Cooperative board met and unanimously voted not to allow Pithia to redeem their RHOC for REV at mainnet.  
A few hours ago they transferred 5M RHOC to Kucoin.  
In response the Cooperative has requested that Kucoin suspend all RHOC trading pairs white we work with their legal team on the Pithia matter.  
Simultaneously, we are working with their team to prepare to get the REV listed.
